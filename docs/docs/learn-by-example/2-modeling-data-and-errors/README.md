# A complete program by example

In [the previous post in the series](/learn-by-example/1-writing-the-initial-program/) we wrote an initial program to create and find users for a Rock Band social network backend.

We will focus on error modeling and handling first, along with data modeling. We will dive into how to control side effects in further lessons.
