# A complete program by example

In [the previous post in the series](/learn-by-example/2-handling-errors/), we learned how to handle erros in our program, but we didn't dive much into how to model our domain data. We learned about data types as a way to raise concerns over our data, but that was pretty much it.

In this post, we will learn how both the Kotlin type system and the functional data types can help to model a safe domain for our programs.

## 3. Modelling data

TBD
